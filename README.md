Excel-based customer analysis using pivot tables and an interactive dashboard to explore demographic and income drivers of bike purchasing behavior.

#  Bike Sales Customer Analysis (Excel)

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes customer demographics and income characteristics to understand the key factors influencing bike purchasing behavior. Using Microsoft Excel, I built pivot-table-driven analysis and an interactive dashboard to identify high-conversion customer segments and generate actionable business insights.

The project is designed as a **portfolio-ready Excel analytics case study**, demonstrating data analysis, business reasoning, and data visualization skills.

##  Objective

To analyze customer demographic and income data in order to:

* Identify which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level demographic and lifestyle information, including:

Two derived variables were created in the working sheet to support segmented analysis:

* **Income Bracket** (derived from raw income data)
* **Age Brackets** (custom age groupings created to analyze purchasing behavior across different life stages)
